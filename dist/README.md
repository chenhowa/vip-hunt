# Introduction
This directory stores all the files used in the hosted version of the game. This includes
html files, css files, and js files (compiled from Typescript source).

# Guide
The root of this distributable is ./css/index.html and ./js/server.js. Once hosted by the server, index.html will call main.js to load the necessary assets and launch the rts game.
